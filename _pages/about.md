I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning at Arizona State University. My research develops spatially adaptive networks—deep learning methods that integrate geospatial theory with computer vision—to improve prediction of socioeconomic conditions from satellite imagery. I focus on challenges such as spatial heterogeneity, imprecise geocoordinates, and the difficulty of transferring models across regions.

My methodological work includes GeoConv, a coordinate-conditioned convolutional architecture; Spatial Imprecision Adjustment (SIA), an algorithm for correcting uncertainty from noisy data; and perturbation-based techniques for domain adaptation. I apply these approaches to global challenges including predicting cross-border migration in Mexico and Central America, estimating wealth across Africa and South Asia, and modeling education outcomes in Southeast Asia. I also lead the Global Education Observatory (GEO) and GEDEX Commons, which build AI-ready, school-level datasets to support equitable education and track progress toward Sustainable Development Goal 4.

I earned my Ph.D. in Computational Geography from William & Mary, where my dissertation, Spatially Adaptive Networks: Architectures, Algorithms, and Applications, developed new methods for combining geospatial theory with deep learning.
